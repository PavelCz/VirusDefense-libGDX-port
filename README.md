Virus Defense libGDX wrapped
==========================
This is more or Less [Virus Defense](https://github.com/Valep42/VirusDefense) of July 19, 2014 (Commit 48058a3), wrapped with libGDX. To port the newest Version of Virus Defense to this libGDX Version requires basically no code change. The src files go into core/src and the data into android/assets/data. When creating a runnable jar, the path of files that will be modified must be changed to `./data/files`, exactly as in the original Virus Defense.

A runnable jar is available at [Releases](https://github.com/Valep42/VirusDefense-libGDX-wrapped/releases).

The libGDX implementation is pased on a libGDX [Demo](https://github.com/badlogic/theplanethatcouldntflygood).
